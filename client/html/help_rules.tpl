<p>In order to upload you must first <a href="/register" alt="register">register an account</a>. We aim to provide a high quality curated experience and uploading is a privilege not a right here. <strong>If you have any questions <a href="https://rarewojak.com/discord" target="_blank">join our discord</a>, channel: #WojakDB</strong>.</p>

Before uploading BE SURE you understand the following rules...

<h2 class='section'>The WojakDB Rules</h2>

<p>1. <strong>NO SHIT WOJAKS</strong>. We spent a ton of time uploading only high quality Wojaks for your art and video projects and want to maintain that quality. If you upload blurry, tiny, or just shit images, expect to lose your upload priveleges.</p>

<p>2. Minimum file size should be 600x600 for a full size Wojak but obviously this varies per image. If it's too small or blurry look into upscaling or repairing it with an AI tool.</p>

<p>3. We much prefer images with a transparent background! This means no ugly traces around the image. Use an AI tool to remove the background if you need to.</p>

<p>4. We prefer smaller images to aid performance and keep hosting fees down. You can compress a PNG with a tool like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a> or <a href="https://compresspng.com/" target="_blank">CompressPNG</a>.</p>

<p>5. Practice good tagging by first consulting the <a href="/tags/query=sort%3Ausages">tags page</a>. We much prefer you use an existing tag rather than create a new one.</p>

<p>6. Provide "Relations" for images wherever possible. These are images that almost look alike or have an obvious relationship.</p>

<p>7. Create a short description under 255 characters. You may use markdown here and may include 1 link but if you abuse this expect to lose your account.</p>

<p>8. Whenever possible provide a source for the Wojak. This might be DeviantArt, Reddit, 4chan, etc. You can use Google images or websites like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/" target="_blank">KnowYourMeme</a> to try and determine what the actual source was.</p>

<p>9. NSFW is okay here usually but be sure to label your image as either "sketchy" or "unsafe".</p>

<p>10. Feel free to make propaganda, lulz, and otherwise have fun! Community can assemble in <a href="https://rarewojak.com/discord"target="_blank">our discord</a>, channel: #WojakDB</strong>.</p>
