<p>The Wojak Database or WojakDB aims to end the drought on high quality Wojaks with the Internet's best searchable image bopard repository of everyone's favorite doomer. </p>

<p>Please <a href="/help/rules">read the rules</a> before posting here but the main rule is <u>DO NOT upload low quality Wojaks</u>.</p>

<p>The database of images here are free and open source for your projects but we really appreciate attribution (a link back). The image board runs on <a href="https://github.com/milezzz/szurubooru">wojibooru</a>, a modified instance of szurubooru, which you may also download and play with. The database itself was seeded with images from these main sources:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Personal collection via <a href="https://x.com/l33tguy">@L33TGUY</a></li>
	<li>The <a href="https://rarewojak.com">Rare Wojak NFT</a> project</li>
	<li><a href="https://wojakparadise.net">Wojak Paradise</a> (offline) - using a CC BY-NC open source license</li>
	<li><a href="https://wojak-studio.com">Wojak Studio</a> (offline but coming back?) - using a CC BY-NC open source license</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the images from these collections were upscaled, denoised, had backgrounds removed, compressed, and otherwise improved before uploading.</p>
